/* In the CreatePostForm component create a form with 2 input fields. There should be an input field for the userâ€™s name, and one for the body of their post. Each input field should be bound to its own state variable.*/
/* Implement a handleSubmit method for your form, which should pass the entered values to a function on the App.jsx component. That function should create a new post object, add it to the existing array of posts, and update the App.js state variable with the new array. */
